# Kanban-Group-Work

## Criteria
- It is easy to create a user
- Users must have a name and an avatar (so we can recognise them)
- It is easy to create a project board
- All the project boards need to be displayed somewhere in the app
- A project board should have three areas; todo, doing, done
- On a project board it is possible to create a task
- A task should have textual description and be unassigned or assigned to a user
- Tasks that are assigned to a user need to display the user's avatar on the task
- Tasks start in the 'todo' state
- It is possible to drag and drop tasks from one area to another. i.e. from 'todo' to 'doing'
- Project data is important and so all project boards, users and tasks need to be persisted
